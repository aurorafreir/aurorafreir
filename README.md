## <h2 align="center"> Howdy! I'm Aurora (it/its) 🐕 </h2>

I'm a Technical Animator with a big interest in anything character or character tech related! 

The bulk of my most recent code can be found [here!](https://github.com/aurorafreir/tools) and is a mix of Maya and Blender code, with some upcoming Krita and Perforce code upcoming :)
